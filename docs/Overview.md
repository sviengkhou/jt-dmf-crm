# JT-DMF Compute Resource Management

The JT-DMF Compute Resource Management (CRM) project provides vendors with a platform-agnostic way to declare the resources required by a Media Function.

A CRM manifest describes the compute, memory, storage, networking, accelerator, and other infrastructure resources that a Media Function needs to operate safely and predictably. The manifest is independent of any specific hardware platform, cloud provider, container runtime, or orchestration technology.

## Architecture & System Model

CRM links design-time resource specification with runtime orchestration, deployment, and operational monitoring across four 
primary architectural tiers:

![DMF overall](images/DMF-overall.svg)

**Application and UI Tier:** High-level Media Workloads composed of one or more modular Applications.

**Media Functions Tier:** Standardizes core logic into discrete Media Functions. Defines the overall **Media Function Descriptor** and the primary **Manifests Schema** (the contract definition).

**Container Platform Tier:** Receives active **Manifests** consumed by dedicated **Operator(s)** to instantiate the **Media Processing Workload**. As the workload executes, it emits **Media Function Metrics** to monitor real-time performance.

**Host Platform Tier:** Exposes underlying physical hardware capabilities via **System Specifications** to inform scheduling decisions.

**Orchestration & Monitoring:** Cross-tier services responsible for evaluating host specifications against manifest requirements, selecting execution environments, and tracking runtime metrics.

## Purpose of This Repository

The purpose of this repository is to define and demonstrate a standardized approach for creating and using CRM manifests throughout the lifecycle of a Media Function.

It provides examples and guidance for:

1. **Profiling a Media Function**  
   Observing how the Media Function uses compute, memory, storage, network bandwidth, and specialized hardware resources under representative operating conditions.

2. **Benchmarking its performance**  
   Measuring the relationship between allocated resources, workload characteristics, performance, and operational limits.

3. **Producing a CRM manifest**  
   Translating the profiling and benchmarking results into a portable, machine-readable declaration of the resources required by the Media Function.

4. **Deploying the Media Function**  
   Demonstrating how an orchestration layer can consume the manifest, evaluate available infrastructure, select an appropriate execution environment, and deploy the Media Function with the required resources.

## Intended Workflow

The repository supports the following workflow:

```text
Media Function
      |
      v
Profile and Benchmark
      |
      v
Determine Resource Requirements
      |
      v
Produce CRM Manifest
      |
      v
Orchestration Layer
      |
      v
Validate, Place, and Deploy
      |
      v
Monitoring
```

This approach allows resource requirements to be based on measured behavior rather than assumptions or platform-specific deployment configurations.

## Benefits

Using a published CRM manifest enables:
- Vendors to describe resource requirements independently of the target platform.
- Orchestrators to make informed placement and scheduling decisions.
- Media Functions to be deployed consistently across heterogeneous infrastructure.
- Infrastructure providers to validate resource availability before deployment.
- Operators to achieve more predictable performance and resource utilization.
- The media industry to improve interoperability between Media Functions, platforms, and orchestration systems.

## Scope

This repository contains:
- CRM manifest definitions and supporting models.
- Example resource manifests for Media Functions.
- Examples of profiling and benchmarking methodologies.
- Guidance for translating benchmark results into resource declarations.
- Examples showing how an orchestration layer can consume a CRM manifest.
- Demonstrations of manifest-based validation, placement, and deployment.

The CRM manifest does not prescribe how an orchestration platform must be implemented. Instead, it provides a common resource description that different orchestration systems can interpret and map to their own infrastructure and deployment models.

## Repository Layout

- docs/: Documentation and supporting background material.
- manifest/: Resource manifests and schema.
- lib/: Code and submodules, including lib/mxl.
- examples/: Runtime examples and deployment assets.

## Real-World Deployment Patterns

Media Functions are developed by many vendors, who leverage different deployment patterns. The DMF architecture needs to support a wide range of these, minimizing the additional development cost for vendors to bring their products to DMF platforms.

### Basic Media Functions involve:

- Single pod (quite commonly, and in the limit, a single container) per Media Function instance
- No Media Function-specific shared services

### More complex Media Functions can have:

- Either/or:
    - Multiple pods per Media Function instance `[1..N]`
    - Multiple Media Function instances per pod, where a logical Media Function instance is an independently configured session/channel/task, with some upper bounds on the number supported by each deployed pod `[N..1]`
- Media Function kind-specific shared context and services (for example, asset storage)
- Media Function kind-specific cluster-wide configuration and services (for example, site license server)

## Proposed Domain Model

![CRM Domain Model](images/crm-domain-model.drawio.png)

### Media Function

- Represents a particular configured instance or session of a well-defined unit of functionality that produces and/or consumes a tightly coupled group of one or more live media streams.
- The particular vendor/product Media Function specification defines the input and output characteristics, such as:
    - Control type (NMOS, etc.)
    - Transport (MXL, etc.)
    - Media format type and properties

These characteristics can be used to plan connections between compatible inputs and outputs.

### Media Function Context

- Represents a management group of Media Functions that could be used to keep multiple live productions separate, for example, with separate asset storage.

### Media Function Config

- Represents cluster-wide configuration and deployment of high-level components, such as a database or license server, that can or should serve multiple Contexts.

> Compute Resource Management could be appropriate at any of these levels.

## Level Trigger Pattern and Desired State Reconciliation

*Based on: "Why Implementing Kubernetes Operators Is a Good Idea!" (Kubermatic)*

![Kubernetes Reconciliation](images/k8s-reconciliation.drawio.png) 

Custom Resource contains:

- Spec
- Status
   
Operator control loop watches the resource.

Operator updates managed objects such as:

- Deployments
- ConfigMaps
- Services

Changes are observed and reconciled continuously to maintain the desired state.
